      "If anyone had predicted that synchronous worldwide growth would be accelerating \n",
      "in the ninth year of a global recovery after the second worst economic downturn of \n",
      "the past hundred years, we would have been impressed. Had they further predicted \n",
      "that this acceleration would occur after the UK voted to leave the European Union \n",
      "\n",
      "and after the US elected a volatile, politically inexperienced real estate billionaire as \n",
      "its President, we might have thought them daft. And yet, here we are. Welcome to \n",
      "Outlook 2018!\n",
      "While risky assets seem unlikely to deliver returns as strong as they did in 2017, we \n",
      "are bullish entering the year. Citi Private Bank recently raised its tactical allocation \n",
      "\n",
      "to equities and reduced its recommended exposure to ˜xed income. We now believe \n",
      "that the most attractive opportunities lie outside the US. We are particularly \n",
      "positive about the prospects for emerging markets, especially in Asia. We also \n",
      "\n",
      "believe that there are several potential ways to earn attractive yields, despite \n",
      "today™s continued low interest rate environment. And ˜nally, we identify distinctive \n",
      "themes Œ from disruptive innovation to healthcare technology Œ that offer the \n",
      "\n",
      "potential for smart, sustainable investment opportunities.\n",
      "Although we expect further positive returns from markets in 2018, we also expect \n",
      "an increase in market volatility. Every time the US Federal Reserve has changed \n",
      "its monetary policy in recent years, a shift in market volatility has occurred. With \n",
      "volatility low but likely to increase, now is the time to help enhance your portfolio \n",
      "\n",
      "with hedges and other strategies designed to assist with protecting your wealth.\n",
      "Put simply, our principal investment recommendation is to ‚go global now.™ There are \n",
      "important bene˜ts of global portfolio diversi˜cation Œ particularly the higher return \n",
      "potential and downside risk mitigation. By shifting away from allocations biased to \n",
      "your home market, you increase the potential risk-adjusted returns of your portfolio. \n",
      "Our most important message in Outlook 2018 concerns portfolios as a whole. \n",
      "Despite our best efforts, many clients do not follow the vital principles and \n",
      "\n",
      "practices that have helped some families remain among the world™s wealthiest for \n",
      "generations. We therefore revisit these, highlighting the risks to wealth of failing to \n",
      "create and follow an appropriate long-term plan. We then encourage all clients to \n",
      "\n",
      "take advantage of the personalized reports that we are offering to help align their \n",
